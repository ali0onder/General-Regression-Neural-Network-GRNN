# General Regression Neural Network (GRNN)
Proposed by D.F. Specht in 1991, the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is a variant of radial basis neural networks. It serves versatile purposes such as regression, prediction, and classification, making it a viable solution for online dynamical systems. GRNN stands out as an enhanced technique in neural networks focused on nonparametric regression, where each training sample signifies a mean for a radial basis neuron.
